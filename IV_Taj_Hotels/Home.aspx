                <p class="work-heading">Sadhya</p>
                <p class="work-text"> Sadhya is a traditional Indian feast originating from the state of Kerala. All of the small dishes are vegetarian, and one sadhya feast can contain up to 28 dishes at a time, all of them traditionally served on banana leaves and meant to be eaten with hands.

This feast is typically served for Onam, the state festival of Kerala. Rice is usually served on the lower side of the leaf as the main dish, and the first dish after the rice is parippu – a curry made from ghee and small gram. It's followed by sambar, a stew of vegetables cooked in gravy of onions, chilis, coriander, lentils, and turmeric.

Among a huge variety of dishes, some of them include upperi (banana chips), sharkara varatti (sweet jaggery chunks), naranga curry, elisheri (stewed pumpkin, red beans, and coconut), kaalan (yogurt, coconut, and banana or yam), inji curry, parripu curry, sambhar, pappadam, kichadi, kootu curry, and rasam (tamarind soup), while the last dish is usually payasam, a traditional dessert that's similar to a pudding.

This huge feast is usually served for lunch.</p>

                <p class="work-heading">Biriyani</p>
                <p class="work-text">Biryani came to India from the Middle East by the time of the Mughal’s, specifically by the 10th century, with the advent of Muslim traders in Southeast Asia and Indian traders across the Middle East. This was a very delicious and different version of the dish (likely with the help of cloves) which the Mughal’s brought with them when they set off for the subcontinent.

In the time of the Maharajas, biryani came to be referred as Balochi Biryani. The word biryani probably came to India due to the influence of Persia in the Baloch region of Southern Afghanistan and Balochistan. It became popular with the Mughals and was introduced to Europe and the United States in the 20th century.</p>
